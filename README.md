###Setup/Installation:

* Install the required tools:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mpd mpc python-pip screen python-dev libssl-dev python-pip python-virtualenv libffi-dev
```
* Test that `mpc` is working by entering the command `sudo mpc`. You should see output like 
```
volume: 80%   repeat: off   random: off   single: off   consume: off
```
There are [futher instructions for setting up/testing mpc](http://www.gmpa.it/it9xxs/?p=727) if you want them.
* Clone this repository to your home directory if you have not done that yet:
```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:mick88/play-pi.git
cd play-pi
```
* Install RadioPi:
```bash
# Use virtual environment
virtualenv .
source bin/activate
# Make sure that latest version of pip is installed
pip install pip --upgrade
pip install -r requirements.txt -c constraints.txt
# Create database
./manage.py migrate
# Create admin account
./manage.py createsuperuser
```
* Import your music from Google Play music:
```bash
# Link your google account
./manage.py setup
./manage.py sync_gplay --create-thumbsup
```
To get your device ID, dial `*#*#8255#*#*` on your Android phone, or have a look on the App Store - there are many apps that will display it for you. iOS users can use their device's uuid prepended by `ios:`.
It's highly recommended you use an [application specific password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) for this.
#### Running the website
There are two ways to run the website:
##### Use `runserver` command
This is the easiest method, the website is served by Django's `runserver` command. You need to run the command as a superuser in order to serve from port 80:
```bash
sudo su
source bin/activate
sudo ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:80
```
##### Install as apache site
This is the preferred method if you want to use this project as a permanent installation as it will start automatically as soon as your Pi is powered up, and does not require user session to run.

These instructions assume that the project is located in `/home/pi/src/play-pi` and you have user `pi`. If your setting is different, you will have to edit `play-pi.conf` and adjust the steps accordingly.

Follow steps listed in **Setup/Installation** first to install dependencies and setup the database.

```bash
# Install apache2 and mod_wsgi
sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi
# Symlink `play-pi.conf` to your sites available and enable:
sudo ln -s /home/pi/src/play-pi/apache2/play-pi.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/play-pi.conf
sudo a2ensite play-pi
# Collect static files so they can be served by apache
./manage.py collectstatic --noinput
# Restart apache 
sudo apache2ctl graceful
```
If there are any errors you will find them in the apache error log: `/var/log/apache2/error.log`


### API
The project exposes REST API using Django Rest Framework. The API is located at `/api/`. 
All endpoints are open for GET requests without authentication. To make POST and DELETE requests, you need to [authenticate](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/4-authentication-and-permissions/#authenticating-with-the-api). 
Available Endpoints:
- `/api/tracks/` - list of songs stored in Google Play Music. To search, add `search` get parameter
- `/api/albums/` - list of albums stored in Google Play Music 
- `/api/playlists/` - list of playlists stored in Google Play Music 
- `/api/radio_stations/` - list of radio stations
- `/api/status/` - media player status. 
    - POST to this url to control playback, volume etc
- `/api/queue/` - playback queue, returns list of both tracks and radio stations in the queue. 
Available methods
    - POST - Add item to queue (insert at specific position with url `/api/queue/{id}`)
    - DELETE - clear queue (or delete item with specific mpd_id with url `/api/queue/{id}`)
- `/api/queue/current` - Currently played item in the queue 
- `/api/play/tracks` - play list of tracks POSTed to this url
- `/api/play/radios` - play list of radio stations POSTed to this url
- `/api/jump/{track|radio|next|previous}` - jump to item in playlist
    - POST `radio` or `track` instance to jump to the specific item.
    - POST `previous` or `next` without body to jump to the next/previous item relative to current one
- `/api/auth/login/` - login endpoint for token authentication

### Setup hardware interface
The project is capable of taking input from buttons connected to GPIO pins. You can configure connected buttons and assign them to actions in the admin backend:

* Connect buttons to GPIO pins and ground. If you don't know how to, refer to a [tutorial](http://razzpisampler.oreilly.com/ch07.html).
* Update button configuration in the admin back-end `/admin/hardware/gpiobutton/`
    * update BCM channels to the ones where each button is actually connected
    * enable the buttons you are using and leave others disabled
* Add button handler script to `init.d` on your raspberry pi: `sudo ln -s /home/pi/src/play-pi/radio_buttons.sh /etc/init.d/radio_buttons.sh` - if your project path is different, adjust the command
* Reboot your Raspberry Pi and your buttons should work
* **Advanced**: You can add more actions by implementing `on_X_press()` methods in `hardware.management.commands.gpio_buttons.Command`.
